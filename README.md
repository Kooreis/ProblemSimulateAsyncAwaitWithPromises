# Question: How do you simulate async/await behavior manually using Promises? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code simulates the behavior of async/await by using Promises. The function `simulateAsyncOperation` returns a new Promise, which is an object representing a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved at some point in the future. Inside this Promise, a `setTimeout` function is used to simulate an asynchronous operation that takes 2 seconds to complete. Once the operation is completed, the Promise is resolved with a string "Async operation completed". If there was an error during the operation, the Promise would be rejected and an error would be thrown. The `then` method is used to schedule a callback function that will be called once the Promise is resolved, and the result of the operation is logged to the console. If the Promise is rejected, the `catch` method catches the error and logs it to the console. This way, the code simulates async/await behavior manually using Promises.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is more complex than the JavaScript version, but it also provides more functionality. The TypeScript version simulates multiple asynchronous operations and chains them together using the `then` method, whereas the JavaScript version only simulates a single operation.

In terms of language features, the TypeScript version uses type annotations to specify the types of the parameters and the return value of the `simulateAsyncOperation` function. This is a feature that is not available in JavaScript. The TypeScript version also uses template literals to construct the string that is passed to the `resolve` function, whereas the JavaScript version uses a static string.

The TypeScript version also includes error handling with the `catch` method, which is not present in the JavaScript version. This allows the TypeScript version to handle any errors that might occur during the execution of the asynchronous operations.

In terms of methods, both versions use the `Promise` constructor to create a new Promise and the `then` method to handle the resolution of the Promise. The TypeScript version also uses the `catch` method to handle any errors, which is not used in the JavaScript version.

# C++ Differences

The JavaScript version of the solution uses Promises to simulate async/await behavior. It defines a function `simulateAsyncOperation` that returns a new Promise. This Promise resolves after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds), simulating an asynchronous operation. The `then` method is used to handle the resolved value of the Promise, and the `catch` method is used to handle any errors that occur during the execution of the Promise.

The C++ version of the solution uses the `std::promise` and `std::future` classes from the C++ Standard Library to simulate async/await behavior. It defines a global `std::promise` object `prom` and a function `printGlobalPromise` that gets a `std::future` from `prom` and waits for it to have a value using the `get` method. This blocks the thread until the value is available, simulating the await behavior. The `main` function creates a new thread that runs `printGlobalPromise`, sets a value for `prom`, and then waits for the thread to finish using the `join` method.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences between JavaScript and C++:

- JavaScript uses Promises for asynchronous operations, while C++ uses `std::promise` and `std::future`.
- JavaScript uses the `then` and `catch` methods to handle the resolved value and errors of a Promise, while C++ uses the `get` method to wait for a `std::future` to have a value.
- JavaScript uses a single-threaded event loop model, while C++ can create multiple threads using the `std::thread` class.
- JavaScript uses the `setTimeout` function to simulate an asynchronous operation, while C++ sets a value for a `std::promise` to simulate an asynchronous operation.
